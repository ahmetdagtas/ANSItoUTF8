# ANSItoUTF8
Changes broken subtitle characters to the proper characters

Many of us suffer subtitles are written in UTF8 encoding but, somehow they are becoming ANSI for the first time when we download them.
I encountered this problem not only Windows, but in Ubuntu, too.

So, I decided to end this problem. For now, it is only for Windows.

You just drag your subtitle to output .exe, voila!

Enjoy your time!
